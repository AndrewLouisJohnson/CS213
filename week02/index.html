            <p>My name is Andrew Johnson and I am a 24 year old Data
              Scientist.</p>
            <p>I have been attending BYU-Idaho for the past 4 years and I will
              graduate in July. I have not always know what I wanted to do and
              it took me more semesters then normal for me to finaly decide on
              what I wanted to do. Durring one of my classes as a Business
              Analysis student my professor told me to lookin into the Data
              Science degree and have been happy thereever since.</p>
            <p>Idaho is my home state, but me and my wife are looking to move
              to either Utah or Texas when I graduate.</p>
            <p>My wife Rachel and I have been married for 2 and 1/2 years
              now, and each enjoy being married to our best friend. We have
              a beautiful 4 month old boy A.J. who has completely taken over our
              lives and we couldnt be happier.</p>
