    <h1><a href="home.html">Updated site here</a> </h1>
    <h1>Gallery split up into "slideshow"</h1>
    <p><strong>Sequences</strong></br>

    <p>The guidelines make it clear that it is wise to mirror how content is
      displayed in printe. Since the content here are pieces of art, which is
      normally viewed sequentially in books and magazines I thought it would
      be wise to place it sequentially, with "Previous" and "Next"links.

    <h1>Each gallery page now has the main site heading</h1>
    <p><strong>Landmarks</strong></br>

    </p>
    <p>Having a landmark like the website name at the top of each page makes a
      big difference in terms of helping users orient themselves. At any given
      moment, it is important for users to understand where they are.

    <h1>New navigation bar, page subheadings</h1>
    <p><strong>Supporting Web Search Users</strong></br>

      <strong>Scan columns</strong></br>

    </p>
    <p>In the links above, the guidelines helped me see the importance of
      helping users understand what is going on when they randomly enter a page
      from a web search. I've also created a new vertical navigation bar.
      Users have come to expect that navigation tools are conventially present
      so I tried to accommodate that.

    <h1>Improved my color's</h1>
    <p><strong>Simplicity and consistency</strong></br>
      <a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/4-interface-design/3-interface-design.html">link</a>
    </p>
    <p>I removed the background colors behind each of the gallery items. As
      the guidelines state, "Users are not impressed with complexity that seems
      gratuitous".
